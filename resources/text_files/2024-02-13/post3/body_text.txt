I have been diagnosed four years ago with OCD, in particular related to contamination (germs, bacteria, body fluids and pollutants).

I am particularly sensible to cigarette smoke, it freaks me out and doesn’t allow me to get any close to cigarette smokers.

My new roommate is a smoker, and his room is next to mine. I didn’t know him but his look was quite “bold”, he has piercings, tattoos, looks very tall and he gave ma an overall bad impression.

Yesterday he wrote a message on our house chat group that he wouldn’t be home, and tonight I happened to not be able to sleep because of the terror that he might smoke in his room through the window contaminating mine as well.

I decided to walk in his room knowing he wouldn’t be there to check for any sign of him smoking inside his room, but I found him still sleeping.

I pretended I suffer from sleepwalking and this allowed me to know him better. Turns out the dude is a super well educated guy who has a Chemical engineering degree, and offered himself to help me relax, drink some water and get fresh air. I apologised to him and gave him a lift to work as he doesn’t have a car or a bike.

Now I feel terrible, cause I did something terrible to a genuinely nice guy and even pretended a “”illness”” (i know sleepwalking isn’t an illness) and I feel like an immature douchebag who deserves absolutely no love from anyone.

I also feel disconnected to reality, almost like irrational took control over my rational life. I act non-sense, I’m controlled by my contamination obsession every day, for every single second of my life. I need to put my clothes out of the room just in case some contaminants went into them, I wash my hands multiple times per hour, and I need to make my girlfriend follow strict rules in order to prevent my anxiety.

I feel hopeless
