For context, I have a less severe case of mobius syndrome. So in middle school, we had swapped seats and I sat next to this girl Jolie. Her friend Stacy sat behind us. (Fake names.) We had moved seats and her friend started to talk to her. Stacy thought she was whispering but I heard everything. She had said that she felt bad for Jolie. Stacy then said that she was sitting next to me “the weird looking kid”. So I knew I had to get revenge. For some more context, everytime we would have a test in this class, the teacher would come around and check our desks to see if we had any study guides with us. We weren’t allowed them and our teacher had stated that if we were caught with one it was a automatic fail. So the next time we had a test, I snuck a study guide in Stacy’s desk and waited. When the teacher came around to Stacy’s desk she had found the study guide. Stacy tried to tell her it wasn’t hers but the teacher wasn’t having it. She made her sit off to the side and failed her for the test. Stacy was crying and at the time I was laughing in my head. Do I feel bad about it now? Yes a bit.
