I’m a nanny for a 4 month old baby. My shifts are often 5am-2:30pm because the parents leave for work very early. I’m super tired at this hour and the baby sleeps until 8/9 anyways. I set alarms every 15 minutes and can always hear if the baby wakes up and is fussing. I’m just SO exhausted that time in the morning and have no energy to do anything with myself while the baby sleeps.

But I feel so guilty…the parents didn’t say specifically whether or not I can sleep but something about it just feels wrong idk??
