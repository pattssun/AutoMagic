Last year, my world turned upside down. My husband left me for someone younger, leaving behind debt in my name, and then I lost my job. Despite a solid decade in marketing and a strong portfolio, my job hunt—over 2000 applications and just a handful of interviews—yielded nothing, even after professional resume overhauls.

With no support and facing desperation, I applied everywhere, from McDonald's to retail, adjusting my resume to avoid appearing overqualified. I even sought apprenticeships in skilled trades, only to be turned away, partly due to my disability that limits my job options, though I remained willing to try almost anything.

The few freelance gigs I landed didn't cover my rent. Out of options and unable to afford basics, I confided in a friend and took a path I never imagined: sex work. It's a choice born of necessity, not desire, and it's taken a toll on me—humiliating and dehumanizing. Yet, I haven't given up on finding a way out, continuing to apply for traditional jobs in hope of escaping this situation.
