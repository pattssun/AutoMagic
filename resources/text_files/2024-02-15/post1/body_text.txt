Living away on an internship, I found myself drawn into an unexpected whirlwind with one of our bosses. Known for his distant demeanor, he surprised me by singling me out at parties, his flirtatious teases setting my heart racing. He was my "happy crush," with that irresistible bad-boy charm.

At a party, things escalated. He kissed me, and I, caught in the moment, kissed back. His advances became more daring, but a friend intervened, ensuring nothing further happened that night. Yet, on February 13, he messaged again, flirting and suggesting we spend Valentine's together. Despite no hotel availability, he came to my condo, and in a moment of recklessness, we became intimate without protection.

Afterwards, fraught with concern, I opted for emergency contraception, following the Yuzpe method to mitigate the risk. His messages about "next time" continue, fueling a mix of anxiety and anticipation within me. Despite the potential risks, the excitement of these stolen moments tempts me, making me ponder the balance between desire and caution as my internship draws to a close.
