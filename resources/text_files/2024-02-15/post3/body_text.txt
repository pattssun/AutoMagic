I'm 29M

So, when I was 15. I was in algebra class, there was an attractive teacher that was my special education teacher. I wish I could take this back, somehow talk to myself then and tell him no. But I was curious and I thought she was hot and just wanted to see how part of her body felt. When she was walking by, I intentionally stuck one of my elbows out and it glanced her butt. She had no idea, I did it in such a way that made it look like I was putting my head on my desk. She worked with me after that, had full conversations with me, and had no idea what I had done. She probably thought it was just an accident.

I don't know why that guilt is affecting me now. Maybe its a sign I've grown, maybe I'm a piece of shit, maybe I don't deserve any forgiveness. But it's gotta get out, some accountability is needed.
