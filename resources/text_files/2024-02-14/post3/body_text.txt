One night in college, while driving to pick up liquor for a frat party, I hit a man crossing the street. It happened so fast; one moment I glanced at my radio, and the next, he was bouncing off my car. The shock and horror were immediate. Despite the urge to flee, I stopped and rushed to his aid, only to find his family witnessing the tragedy from a nearby restaurant, their screams piercing the night.

The man lay bleeding, surrounded by his family's grief and bystanders calling for help. Overwhelmed by guilt, I could only mutter apologies, realizing the gravity of my mistake. As paramedics arrived, I was left sobbing on the curb, haunted by the family's anguish.

In an act of unimaginable grace, his widow approached me, sharing that they had been married for nearly 50 years, offering forgiveness in my darkest moment. Though deemed an accident, the event sent me spiraling into despair, leading to heavy drinking, dropping out of college, and a failed suicide attempt.

It took years, but I found a path forward through joining the Navy, seeing the world, and planning to return to college. With the support of friends and new beginnings, I'm slowly rebuilding, holding onto hope for a brighter future despite the shadows of that night.
