I'm part of a big company where our floor feels like a gossip-filled small town, home to around 100 people. Within this setting, I've spent the last five years stirring the pot by anonymously sending Valentine's cards to coworkers. To the guys, the cards hint at a secret desire to connect outside work, fearing for my professional image. For the ladies, it's all about expressing a crush, wanting to date them.

This yearly tradition has become my own personal soap opera, with no one catching on to the repeat performances. The reactions, especially from men discussing their female colleagues in frankly inappropriate ways, provide an enlightening yet unspoken commentary on office dynamics. I'm a silent observer, learning about my coworkers' true colors without ever joining in.

The women, on the other hand, approach the mystery with a more analytical mind, speculating on relationship statuses and orientations, influenced by the romantic tone of their cards.

This confession highlights my awareness of the emotional rollercoaster I cause, particularly for the women who might get their hopes up. Despite knowing it's wrong, the lure of the ensuing drama is too tempting to resist. I ensure the messages stay harmless, avoiding anything that could truly frighten someone, sticking to a tone akin to high school crushes.
