In the 90s, while working at a fast-food joint during my high school days, I stumbled upon a goldmine. The place was ditching paper gift certificates for plastic gift cards. If you used more than half the certificate's value, they'd refund the difference in cash. My manager claimed he'd destroyed all the old certificates, but one night, I discovered boxes full of them, supposedly shredded, hidden in storage.

I secretly retrieved these treasures, finding an astonishing amount: 1,000 $25 certificates, 1,000 $10 ones, and 500 $5 ones, totaling $40,000 in fast-food currency. With my manager having reported these as destroyed, my secret was safe.

Over the next few years, my girlfriend and I became nomadic fast-food connoisseurs, visiting outlets across five states, always ordering just over half the certificate's value to maximize our cash back. We didn't track our exploits but became experts at maximizing returns from the menu.

The loot funded my first car purchase, a $7,800 cash buy. A peculiar hack with $1.05 kiddie cones, exchanged with a $5 certificate for $3.95 back, meant we discarded many cones. This adventure not only fed us but fueled a significant chapter of my life, all from exploiting a loophole in a fast-food chain's outdated gift certificate system.
