I worked as a janitor in a school. There was a dedicated janitors closet which was quite spacious. After I had finished vacuuming all the classes in the afternoon, I had to turn the security system on and leave within a minute.

There was a caveat though, the front gate and the dedicated janitor closet were exempted from the motion cameras.

I couldn't justify (or afford) spending half of my paycheck a week for what should be a human right - shelter. So I did what I had to do and simply lived in that closet. I saved over $20,000 in rent

I installed a mini-fridge and a air-fryer and had quite the time. The contract got changed so I lost that gig.

I feel a bit bad for freeloading off the school, but the government can provide insulated sheds to all of its citizens for a few billions but would rather spend much more on war and overinflated salaries for its oligarchs.

I wouldn't do it again, best commute ever though.
