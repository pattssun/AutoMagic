I am an introverted person who likes to have his own space and this friend when he comes over he stays the whole day like from ten thirty in the morning and most of the time I haven't eaten breakfast yet and he stays until Six to Seven at night.

Like I just graduated so am still searching for jobs, so am always home. But the thing is since I don't have a job yet, I don't have anything to feed him all day and that bugs me a lot makes me feel like a bad person, who does care but the real truth is am broke.

So pretending to be asleep for 1h30 minutes until he leaves and that is the sacrifice am willing to make to have the whole day to myself applying for jobs than to open for him and spend the whole day miserable constantly thinking about what are we going to eat.
