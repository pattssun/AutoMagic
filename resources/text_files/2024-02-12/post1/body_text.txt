When I was 8 my grandma took my cousins sisters and everyone out to Wendy’s for lunch, I ordered my burger with no tomatoes because I don’t and didn’t like tomatoes and then I went to get ketchup for my fries and my grandma said “you know ketchup has tomatoes in it correct?” From that day forward I have everyone convinced I don’t like ketchup and I even had myself convinced up until the other day when the memory played through my head again and I realized I was just gaslighting everyone. Kinda funny, kinda not. I feel bad to an extend because everyone who knows me thinks I don’t like ketchup but the reality of it is I did and probably still do. I haven’t eaten ketchup since that day and for the sake of 8 year old me I will continue to refuse to eat ketchup because I gotta admire the dedication.
