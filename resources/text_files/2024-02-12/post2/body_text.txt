I went to visit my hometown to hang out with some old friends during a Super Bowl party. A lot of kids from when I was in school were there, including my bully from elementary school. He used to bully the shit out me. My parents used to say it was his way of showing he liked me. But the bruises he left me taught me otherwise. So I did my best to avoid him at the party, even when he tried to chat me up.

The fuck up. I was with my friends. We were just chatting and laughing about what we’ve been doing with our lives. Out of the corner of my eye, I turned and saw my bully taking a video selfie. Instinctively, I stopped smiling, cringed, and turned away from him. I really did not like that guy. When the party was over, and I was heading home, I got a text with my friend with a Facebook link. It was a video my bully slowly panning across the party smiling gleefully. When he caught my attention and I gave him a disgusted look before turning away, his smile vanished, the screen flashed grey, slowed down, and depressing music started playing.

The comments are just as you expect. It was mostly people telling him to keep his crown up and that I’m a bitch, etc etc. It was pretty humiliating. I reported the video to Facebook. But it’s still up, and keeps growing in views and comments.
