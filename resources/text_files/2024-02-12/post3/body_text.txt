Me (18m) and my girlfriend (18f) have been together for almost 2 years now. She kissed a guy "on accident" quite early on in our relationship but managed to gaslight me by being relentlessly hard on her self about it so I forgave her. Not a problem since. She is my first everything, love, sex, kiss everything. I am her 15th body. 3rd boyfriend. We love eachother or atleast i love her very much. Since she is my first i have always been kinda jealous about her guy friends or people in her dms. Nothing has bothered me too much. Recently she admitted to having a manipulative habbit. Especially on guys. So i got a bit more scared. Well today at 02:49 am as i am writing this and she is sleeping next to me. My thoughts got the better of me so i started going through her ig dms. Alot of guys hitting on her but nothing put of the ordinary except this one guy. The had been chatting while my gf was on Ibiza. Flirting talking about kissing and meeting. My girlfriend begged this man to meet because she has been thinking about him so much.

That is fucked. Idk how i can recover. Should i confront her? In that case how? It is really messed up to go through someones phone. Even though what she did was worse. Any advice?
