After a month of temporarily living alone, I had a random urge to see if they left their alcohol in the alcohol cabinet. To my surprise I ended up giving into the urge of wanting to experience what being drunk was like that same night. A week later, I did it again, and the cycle started. All my friends had moved away to university, and they were getting drunk too. I felt like I was just being a typical teenager because of that."
