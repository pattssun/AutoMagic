I am 18 
years old,
and have 
always been 
that studious,
rule following 
daughter my 
parents expected 
me to 
be.
A while 
ago,
my parents 
bought a 
new house,
and we 
are still 
in the 
process of 
moving.
My parents 
and brothers 
live in 
the new 
house,
and I 
remained in 
the old.
After a 
month of 
temporarily living 
alone,
I had 
a random 
urge to 
see if 
they left 
their alcohol 
in the 
alcohol cabinet.
To my 
surprise I 
ended up 
giving into 
the urge 
of wanting 
to experience
what being 
drunk was 
like that 
same night.
A week 
later,
I did 
it again,
and the 
cycle started.
All my 
friends had 
moved away 
to university,
and they 
were getting 
drunk too.
I felt 
like I 
was just 
being a 
typical teenager 
because of 
that.
